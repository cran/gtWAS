\title{
Genome and Transcriptome Wide Association Study
}
\description{
Quantitative trait loci mapping and genome wide association analysis are used to find candidate molecular marker or region associated with phenotype based on linkage analysis and linkage disequilibrium. Expression quantitative trait loci mapping is used to find candidate molecular marker or region associated with gene expression. This package is aimed at revealing the association relationship between phenotype and molecular markers, expression levels, molecular markers with different related expression levels and expression levels with different related molecular marker. F test based on full and reduced model are performed to obtain p value or likelihood ratio statistic. The best linear model can be obtained by stepwise regression analysis.
